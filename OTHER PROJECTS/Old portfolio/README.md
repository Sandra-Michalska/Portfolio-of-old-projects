# The very first portfolio

This is the very first portfolio I created in mid 2016 or so. Just for comparison purposes.

At that time, this web sited helped me to learn how to deal with my first live domain and hosting.

On this web site you can view a few projects I did based on various tutorials and courses. I used some basic stack like HTML, CSS and JavaScript (+jQuery and jQuery UI).
